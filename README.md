# palindrome-birthday

Vanilla JS App which checks if your Birthday is a Palindrome. Runs through all possible date combinations: [ddmmyyyy, mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy, mmddyy, yymdd]. If any of them is a palindrome, it shows the ouput as a palindrome. Otherwise, it shows the next closes palindrome date and how far it is from your birthday
